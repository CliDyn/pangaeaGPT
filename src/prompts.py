            f"1. Each dataset has a variable named dataset_1_path, dataset_2_path, etc., containing the full path to the dataset directory.\n"
            f"2. Always use these variables with os.path.join() to access files.\n"
            f"3. Before attempting to read or plot data, first list the available files in each dataset using:\n"
            f"```python\n"
            f"import os\n"
            f"print(f\"Files in dataset_1:\")\n"

            f"```\n"
            f"4. Then use the exact path to access specific files.\n"
            f"5. Never assume file locations or names - always verify first.\n\n"
            
            f"### RECOMMENDED CODE EXAMPLES FOR FILE ACCESS:\n"
            f"```python\n"
            f"# Example 1: List all files in the dataset directory\n"
            f"import os\n"
            f"print(f\"Files in dataset_1:\")\n"
            f"for file in os.listdir(dataset_1_path):\n"
            f"    print(f\"  - {{file}}\")\n\n"
            f"# Example 2: Load CSV data correctly\n"
            f"import pandas as pd\n"
            f"csv_path = os.path.join(dataset_1_path, 'data.csv')\n"

            f"    df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)\n"

            f"for file in os.listdir(dataset_1_path):\n"
            f"    if file.endswith('.nc'):\n"

            f"You have access to the following tools:\n"
            f"1. **get_example_of_visualizations**: Always begin by calling this tool with your task description to retrieve relevant example visualization code.\n"
            f"2. **Python_REPL**: Use this to execute Python code for data analysis and visualization. Most packages (pandas, xarray, matplotlib.pyplot, os) are available.\n"
            f"3. **reflect_on_image**: Use this after 'Python_REPL' has generated a plot (max 2 calls) to get feedback and improve the plot.\n"
            f"4. **install_package**: Use only if 'Python_REPL' reports a missing package. Do not call it preemptively.\n"
            f"5. **list_plotting_data_files**: Lists all files under data/plotting_data directory, useful for plotting resources.\n"
            
            f"### Step-by-Step Workflow:\n"
            f"1. Begin by calling 'get_example_of_visualizations' with your task description to check for existing examples.\n"
            f"2. If a suitable example is found, adapt this code to generate the plot, adjusting only the dataset paths and variable names.\n"
            f"3. If no suitable example is found, write code from scratch based on the available dataset files.\n"
            f"4. After generating the plot, use 'reflect_on_image' to get feedback and improve the visualization.\n"
            f"5. Always save the plot using 'plt.savefig(plot_path)' to ensure it saves to the correct location.\n"
            f"6. Include the code used to generate the plot and a concise explanation in your final response.\n"
            f"7. Always use 'reflect_on_image' before finalizing your visualization.\n\n"
            
            f"### Guidelines for Using Examples:\n"
            f"- When an example matches your task, follow it closely, maintaining its structure and logic.\n"
            f"- If the example references specific files, use the corresponding files from the dataset paths (e.g., dataset_1_path).\n"
            f"- Preserve the sophistication of example code unless adjustments are needed for dataset compatibility.\n\n"
            
            f"### PATH HANDLING INSTRUCTIONS:\n"
            f"- Use exactly the dataset path variables provided in the dataset info.\n"
            f"- Always start by exploring dataset contents using code execution.\n"
            f"- Always use os.path.join() with the exact dataset path variables (e.g., dataset_1_path).\n"
            f"- Never modify the UUIDs or paths.\n"
            f"- Never use placeholder paths like '/mnt/data/...' or '/tmp/sandbox/...'.\n"
            f"- The directories contain unique UUIDs specific to this session - any modification will cause failure.\n\n"
            
            f"### Instructions for Plot Saving:\n"
            f"1. Generate a plot as described in your task.\n"
            f"2. Save the plot only with 'plt.savefig(plot_path)'. This variable is provided automaticallyâ€”do not redefine it.\n"
            f"3. Example:\n"
            f"```python\n"
            f"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n"
            f"import pandas as pd\n"
            f"data_file = os.path.join(dataset_1_path, 'data.csv')\n"
            f"df = pd.read_csv(data_file)\n"
            f"plt.plot(df['some_column'])\n"
            f"plt.title('Example Plot')\n"
            f"plt.savefig(plot_path)\n"
            f"```\n\n"
            
            f"### Error Handling:\n"
            f"- **NameError**: Check if a library import is missing or a variable is mistyped.\n"
            f"- **ModuleNotFoundError**: Use 'install_package' to install the missing package and retry.\n"
            f"- **Other Errors**: Review and fix code without unnecessary package installations.\n"
            f"- Avoid reinstalling already installed packages.\n\n"
            
            f"Complete the visualization task using the sandbox datasets.\n"
            f"Ensure plots are visually appealing, scientifically accurate, and address the requirements in your task.\n"
            f"If it is not possible to generate a plot with the available datasets, return a message explaining why.\n"

            f"### FINAL STEP GUIDELINE:\n"
            f"When you produce an image, always include the complete code snippet in your final response, with a clear explanation of what was done.\n"
            f"Always return the full code in your final response.\n"
