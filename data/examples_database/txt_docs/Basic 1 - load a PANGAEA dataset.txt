# Basic pangaeapy example: how to load a PANGAEA dataset

--- Cell 3 ---
First we need to import the PanDataSet class from the pangaeapy module:

--- Cell 4 ---
from pangaeapy import PanDataSet

--- Cell 5 ---
Then we create an PANGAEA dataset object. To initialize the object we need to use either a integer ID or an DOI of the dataset we want to use within the constructor. 

--- Cell 6 ---
ds=PanDataSet(896621)

--- Cell 7 ---
A simple test would be to print the title of the database:

--- Cell 8 ---
ds.title

--- Cell 9 ---
ds.citation

--- Cell 10 ---
