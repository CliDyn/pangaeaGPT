#Basic pangaeapy example: how to load a PANGAEA dataset
#First we need to import the PanDataSet class from the pangaeapy module:
from pangaeapy import PanDataSet


--- Cell 3 ---
#Then we create an PANGAEA dataset object. To initialize the object we need to use either a integer ID or an DOI of the dataset we want to use within the constructor.
ds=PanDataSet(896621)

--- Cell 4 ---
#A simple test would be to print the title of the database:
ds.title

--- Cell 5 ---
ds.citation
